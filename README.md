I shut down the social networking platform (twitter/weibo) because of depression.I didn't pay attention to anybody because information would make me nervous.So sorry to my friends who had interacted,I reopened YouTube and uploaded some old hacker demos.I will finish a big article in the next month or so.I believe it will be useful for many people,maybe I won't use social networking platform until I'm better.If you want to follow me,can be in github,it's quiet.I don't have a blog before or sell loopholes.My hacker life is not profitable.So don't be fooled.My mail is myselfexplorer@protonmail.com,if you contact me and my knowledge can help you,I will reply,that's all.
